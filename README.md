<h2>DOM Manipulation – Contact Form</h2>

<p>
Implement a Contact form component. Your form should have:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 text inputs</li>git
  <li>1 radio button</li>
  <li>1 text area</li>
  <li>1 submit button</li>
  <li>an optional image on the right, just to make the form look a little better.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    When clicking the “Submit” button, you should validate the required fields, and display a red border around the input if validation fails.
  </li>
  <li>
    If user corrects the error, you should remove the red border.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the form is successfully submitted (no validation errors) you should display a Confirmation banner (which is hidden initially) containing the user’s first name that you just collected from the input fields.
  </li>
  <li>
    Also all the info from the input fields should be printed in the Console.
  </li>
</ul>
